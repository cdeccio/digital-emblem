   <t>In the physical realm, the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Crystal signify protections
   under International Humanitarian Law. Today, a vast majority of humanitarian organizations rely
   on Internet connectivity to carry out their mission. This document describes a digital version
   of the protective emblem that will provide robust signals to digital actors of a resources protection
   under International Humanitarian Law.</t>

   <t>Protecting digital assets requires a number of critical capabilities:
   <list style="bullets">
      <t>The protected status is visible</t>
      <t>The signal of protection comes from a trusted entity</t>
      <t>The signal of protection cannot be modified by third parties</t>
      <t>The querying of the protective status of an entity does not adversely affect that entity.</t>
   </list></t>

   <t>This document describes a protocol for the creation and publication of a digital emblem utilizing the
   Domain Name System (DNS) global infrastructure. This protocol is modeled after Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
   that is utilized to authorize e-mail senders within a domain <xref target="RFC7208" />.</t>

   <t>The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Protecting Humanitarian Missions">
   <t>TODO : Intro material on protective and indicative use of the emblem</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Protocol Overview">
   <t> The objective of the protocol is to allow humanitarian organizations to signal that digital assets are use 
   to fulfill its mission and therefore are entitled to protection from attack under IHL.
   These assets include both physical and virtual resources (servers, virtual machines, etc.) and network traffic
   associated with those resources. This is accomplished by associating a digital emblem attribute with the DNS
   domain name, or sub-domain, and/or with the IP address(es) associated with those resource(s).</t>

   <t>The following sub-sections describe the three parties associated with the digital emblem and their roles in creating an emblem.</t>

   <section title="Actors">

   <section title="Approvers">
   <t>An Approver is an organization empowered to authorize the use of the emblem. Each member of the United Nations
   has an identified organization tasked with fulfilling this role. All Approvers, or an organization operating on
   their behalf, generate and maintain digital signing
   credentials in TLSA records published in the DNS (Section <xref target="creds"/>).
   An Approver receives requests for use of the digital
   emblem from Requestors. If the request satisfies all necessary requirements, the Approver generates the necessary
   cryptographic material and returns it to the Requestor (Section <xref target="attributes"/>).</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Requestors">
   <t>A Requestor is any organization wishing to use the digital emblem to protect the digital assets associated with
   its humanitarian mission. The Requestor sends the necessary DNS resource information to an Approver. If the Approver
   approves the use of the digital emblem for the identified resources, the Requestor publishes the returned cryptographic
   material in a Digital Emblem Record (Section <xref target="DER"/>).</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Observers">
   <t>An Observer is any entity that wishes to assess the claim of protection under the digital emblem. This is accomplished
   by obtaining both the Digital Emblem Record associated with a target system (domain name or IP address) published by the Requestor
   and the signing certificate associated with the Approver that is identified in the Digital Emblem Record. An Observer then uses the key material
   in the signing certificate to verify the cryptographic material published in the target's Digital Emblem Record (Section
   <xref target="verify"/>).</t>
   </section>
   </section>
   </section>

   <section title="Digital Emblem Material in DNS">
   <section title="Approver Credentials" anchor="creds">
   <t>Approvers generate, publish, and maintain valid digital signing certificates for attesting to Digital Emblem Records.
   These signing certificates MUST be published in the DNS via DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) TLSA Record
   <xref target="RFC6698"/>.</t>

   <t>TODO : Add text on the generation of the key material and signing certificate</t>

   <t>TODO : Add text on necessary DANE TLSA parameters for use with the Digital Emblem per <xref target="RFC7671"/></t>

   <t>All TLSA records MUST be protected by DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
   <xref target="RFC4033"/><xref target="RFC4034"/><xref target="RFC4035"/>.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Digital Emblem Record" anchor="emblem">

   <section title="Approver Generated Material" anchor="attributes">
   <t>Once an Approver has deemed a request to be satisfactory, it generates two pieces of cryptographic material. First,
   the Approver generates a pseudo-random number (i.e., nonce) using a secure random number generator (TBD: need additional
   details on the characteristics of the nonce). Second, the Approver generates a digital signature (FIPS.186-5?)
   using its private key associated with its signing certificate (published in a DNS TLSA record) over the
   nonce and the identifying material (e.g., domain name) provided by the Requestor.</t>

   <t>After generating the above material, the Approver returns the nonce, the digital signature, and a reference to its
   DNS TLSA record containing the corresponding signing certificate.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Digital Emblem Record" anchor="DER">
   <t>A Digital Emblem Record (DER) is a DNS record that declares that a host is protected under IHL. The DER is expressed
   as a single string of text found in the RDATA of a single DNS TXT resource record. Multiple DER records MAY exist for
   the same name. This occurs if the Requestor has received authorization from multiple Approvers. Each DER is placed in the
   DNS tree at the owner name to which it pertains. Given that TXT records serve multiple purposes, publishers need to be
   mindful of size limitations.</t>

   <t>TODO : Need to consider the creation of a new DNS RR type for DER</t>

   <t>A notional DER string is as follows:</t>
   <figure>
   <artwork><![CDATA[
      de=c517d02d6554a9add49b emblem.example.org e5d391930ac48dd482810fed
   ]]></artwork>
   </figure>

   <t>The fields in the DER are as follows:
   <list style="bullets">
      <t>de - indentifies the DER string</t>
      <t>nonce - A pseudo random number generated by the Approver</t>
      <t>reference - The DNS name of the endpoint approving the use of the digital emblem</t>
      <t>signature - Digital signature generated by the Approver</t>
   </list></t>

   <t>Publication of a DER follows all the rules for publishing DNS resource records described in <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
   The DER MUST be protected by DNSSEC.</t>

   <t>TODO : Integrate underscored naming indicator per <xref target="RFC8552"/>.</t>

   <t>The publication of a DER under a domain name indicates protection for that name under IHL. Protection for IP addresses is
   accomplished through the use of the DNS reverse zone. If protection under IHL is requested for an IP address, the Requestor
   MUST:
   <list style="bullets">
      <t>Obtain a proper IP address delegation</t>
      <t>Publish a reverse zone mapping the target IP addresses to domain names</t>
      <t>Requests approval for use of the digital emblem from an Approver for the target domain names</t>
   </list></t>

   </section>
   </section>

   <section title="Digital Emblem Verification" anchor="verify">
   <t>Any entity can act as an Observer and verify the existence and validity of a digital emblem associated with a target system.
   An Observer performs the following tasks:
   <list style="numbers">
      <t>Perform a DNS lookup for a TXT record associated with the target system.</t>
      <t>If a TXT record exists, parse it for a DER. Otherwise, terminate process.</t>
      <t>If a DER exists, extract the nonce, reference, and signature. Otherwise, terminate process.</t>
      <t>Perform a DNS lookup for the TLSA record associated with the reference.</t>
      <t>If the TLSA exists, extract the key material. Otherwise, terminate process.</t>
      <t>Using the retrieved key material, nonce, and target domain name, verify the signature.</t>
   </list>
   If the signature verifies, the target system has protection from the digital emblem. In all other cases, it does not.</t>
