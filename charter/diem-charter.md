# Introduction

Internation law defines a number of emblems as indicators of special protections
or handling. These emblems signal protection for people, objects, and locations.
The physical enstantiations of these emblems have a number of limitations that have
emerged as technology advances and newer capabilities have become available. The
Digital Emblem (DIEM) working group will focus on the developing capabilities that
augment the existing emblem and extend their reach into the digital realm.

# Problem Statement

Physical emblems have served a number of key functions over hundreds of years.
The design/use of those physical emblems were limited by the available resources
and capabilities during the time of their inceptions.  As technology advances and
newer capabilities become available, it is beneficial to examine limitations with
existing emblems and identify potential needs going forward.

Some of those limitations include:

 * Authenticity - Emblems currently do not carry any type of attestation to the validity of the emblem.
 * Visibility - Emblems are not always visible to observing parties.
 * Mis-use - Emblems do not provide sufficient context to indicate the validity of their observed use.
 * Management - Emblems cannot currently be revoked due to abuse, compromise, or expiry.

# Goals

The preliminary [problem statement](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-haberman-digital-emblem-ps/)
documents a number of potential use cases. The working group will explore those use cases to
identify the functional capabilities that are common to a large subset of those use cases.
The working group will:

 * Collaborate with external stakeholders on the development of any additional requirements.
 * Coordinate with other IETF working groups on the re-use of existing efforts to satisfy DIEM requirmeents.
 * Develop new capabilities to satisfy requirements not covered by existing IETF technologies.

# Program of Work

Documents produced by the working group will address one or more of the following topics.

 1. In-depth development and analysis of requirements.
 2. Security framework for digital emblems.
 3. Solutions that satisfy requirements and security needs for targe use cases.
