# Introduction

International law defines a number of emblems as indicators of special protections
or handling. These emblems signal protection for people, objects, and locations.
The physical instantiations of these emblems have a number of limitations that have
emerged as technology advances and newer capabilities have become available. ALTERNATIVE TO PREVIOUS SENTENCE: As technology advances and new capabilities become available, the goal has emerged of complementing physical emblems with digital ones. The
Digital Emblem (DIEM) working group will focus on the developing capabilities that
augment the existing emblem and extend their reach into the digital realm.

# Problem Statement

Physical emblems have served a number of key functions over hundreds of years.
The design/use of those physical emblems were limited by the available resources
and capabilities during the time of their inceptions.  As technology advances and
newer capabilities become available, it is beneficial to examine limitations with
existing emblems and identify REPLACE "potential needs" WITH "enhancements" going forward.

Some of those REPLACE "limitations" WITH "enhancements" include:

 * Authenticity - Emblems currently do not carry any type of attestation to the validity of the emblem  ADD ", but this is possible in a digital emblem"
 * Visibility - Emblems are not always visible to observing parties.
 * Mis-use - Emblems do not provide sufficient context to indicate the validity of their observed use.
 * Management - Emblems cannot currently be revoked REPLACE "due to" with "to address" abuse, compromise, or expiry.

# Goals

The preliminary [problem statement](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-haberman-digital-emblem-ps/)
documents a number of potential use cases. The working group will explore those use cases to
identify the functional capabilities that are common to a large subset of those use cases.
The working group will:

 * Collaborate with external stakeholders on the development of any additional requirements.
 * Coordinate with other IETF working groups on the re-use of existing efforts to satisfy DIEM requirmeents.
 * Develop new capabilities to satisfy requirements not covered by existing IETF technologies.

# Program of Work

Documents produced by the working group will address  COULD DELETE "one or more of" the following topics.

 1. In-depth development and analysis of requirements.
 2. Security framework for digital emblems.
 3. Solutions that satisfy requirements and security needs for target use cases.

COMMENT: how about adding before 1, "Identication of representative use cases embracing the range of potential needs, but allowing the WG to produce actionable work within a practical timeframe"?
